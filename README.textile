h1. SinX

h2. Description

A small starter app using:

* sinatra
* bundler
** uses a standard Gemfile
** @$ bundle install@
* haml
* less
** @set :precompiled_css, false@ to have less compile your css for you on 
every request (this is the default for :development)
** @set :precompiled_css, true@ to have less use a static, compiled css 
file (this is the default for :production)
* rspec
** @$ autotest@
*** autotest-growl is included
* cucmber
** @rake features@

Currently, specs are used to test the SinX functionality. The only feature 
"features/example.feature":example-feature merely proves that @rake features@ works.

h2. Usage

# Clone the repository 
# Run the tests
** @rake spec@
** @rake features@
# Write some cucumber for your specific features
# Red, Green, Refactor
# Use @shotgun@ to run the app (with code reloading) in dev mode
# Use "heroku":heroku to run your app live

h2. Todo

# openid integration, users will be stored in a simple model structure.
